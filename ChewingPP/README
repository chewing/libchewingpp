This directory is only for XCode builder, and it only works on OSX platform.
It's developed only on Panther with Xcode 1.5.

You should have libchewing installed into /usr/local/ in order to make
it work.

This would build a "ChewingPP Framework", and should be installed
into /Library/Frameworks/

OVIMChewing depends on this library to work.
