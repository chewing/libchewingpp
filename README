This library provide C++ wrapper to jserv's libchewing
(http://jserv.sayya.org/wiki/index.php/Qooing).

 Chewingpp.h - Object prototype
 Chewing.cpp - Object implementation

In order to build this library, you'll need to install libchewing first.
After that, you may try

 make
 make test

to see if it works.
